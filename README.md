# AdventureRPG
> RPG style game written in type script

The goal with this project is for me to learn
- Typescript
- Game structure
- RPG mechanics & techniques

## Build
- Open the project with VS Code. Custom build step is include that allows TS transpalition. (ctrl+shift
- The 'deploy' folder contains scripts that allow both publish and IIS installation.

## Installation
Windows Only:
- This project contains assest loading that causes CORS issues, thus it can be hosted on IIS locally as work around.
- Run the 'deploy/install.bat' file in Admin mode. (This process requires some work)
